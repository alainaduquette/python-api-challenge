Hi I understand I missed out on an important part of the assignment and that is setting the git ignore for my API keys. I continuasily tried and can not seem to figure it out. 
I am not the fondest of using termial so I always work on the assignments and then publish to the github website once complete. I could not find a way to make the file a gitginore through the route I typically take.
